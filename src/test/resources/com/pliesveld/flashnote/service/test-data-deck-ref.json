Data sent from one machine is guaranteed to be received in the same order it was sent.  UDP is a datagram protocol, and delivery is not guaranteed.  TCP has a session state in the kernel that must be setup in a three-way handshake.  It maintains the last acknowledged sequence number, and the last sent frame, window size, and timeouts.  UDP is fire and forget.  "
